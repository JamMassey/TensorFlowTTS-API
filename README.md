## TensorFlow TTS API

A scaffold for a TensorFlow TTS API. Solves some known issues in getting the library installed in container, and provides some abstractions for using the out of the box moxels. Plans for now are to only provide inference endpoints, and maybe one day introduce training.

#### TODOs

- Actually link up the sythesis code with the API endpoints.
