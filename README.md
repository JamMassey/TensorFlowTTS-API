## TensorFlow TTS API

A scaffold for a TensorFlow TTS API. Solves some known issues in getting the library installed in container, and provides some abstractions for using the out-of-the-box models. Plans for now are to only provide inference endpoints, and maybe one day introduce training. Just for fun/learning with Dcoker - I am looking at moving to a more supported lib and exploring further around TTS.

#### TODOs

- Actually link up the sythesis code with the API endpoints.
